# AU-Falcon-SPUD-Project
A collation of notes and information about the AU Falcon, collated while working on an Amaretto Gold Series 1 Forte, nicknamed "SPUD" because it looks like a potato
<!--TODO add a artists rendition lol-->

> NOTE: This is a preservation project, made as well as possible using very limited resources, for the benefit of anyone who wants to save themselves some of the headaches I encountered going off of the beaten track and finding myself swimming in dead links in long-forgotten forum threads

***ALL INFORMATION IS WIP AS OF 09/09/2024***

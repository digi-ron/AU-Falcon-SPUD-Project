A collation of notes and information about the AU Falcon, collated while working on a Falcon Forte, nicknamed "SPUD".

> NOTE: The information here is *most* accurate for the MY 1999 S1 Ford Falcon Forte Sedan, but as much information as possible has been added for other variants

> This is an information preservation project, made as well as possible using very limited resources, for the benefit of anyone who wants to save themselves some of the headaches I encountered going off of the beaten track and finding myself swimming in dead links in long-forgotten forum threads.
> 
> This ***IS NOT*** meant to be the AU Falcon Bible, but rather a last resort to get information that has started to disappear from the wider internet.
> 
> In the spirit of things there are as few links to the wider internet here as possible

***ALL INFORMATION IS WIP AS OF: <span style="color: orange">20th September, 2024</span>***

# Reading the Tickford Option Plate

Some models of AU Falcon were modified by Tickford in some way. In these cases, an additional plate is riveted to the inside of the hood of the affected models.

## Tickford Options plate VS Tickford Build Number Plate

T-Series models of the AU Falcon (TE50/TS50/TL50) did not appear to have Tickford option plates. Instead they were fitted with a Build number plate, which contains a build number vertically on the left side, and a Tickford "Winged T" logo, the Model number (TE50/TS50/TL50) and the VIN Number on the right side.

> No image of T-Series Build Number plate added as no T-series models included in project

## Location

The Tickford plate, if present, can be found on the drive side of the inside of the hood, next to the coolant overflow reservoir

> No images for the location added as no vehicles used for this project had Tickford based modifications

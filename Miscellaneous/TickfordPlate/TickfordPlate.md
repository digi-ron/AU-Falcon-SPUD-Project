# Reading the Tickford Option Plate

Some models of AU Falcon were modified by Tickford in some way. In these cases, an additional plate is riveted to the inside of the hood of the affected models.

## Location

The Tickford plate, if present, can be found on the drive side of the inside of the hood, next to the coolant overflow reservoir

> No images for the location added as no vehicles used for this project had Tickford based modifications

# Reading the Tickford Vehicle Engineering (TVE) Plate

Some models of AU Falcon were modified by Tickford in some way. In these cases, an additional plate is riveted to the inside of the hood of the affected models.

## Tickford Options Plate VS Tickford Build Number Plate

T-Series models of the AU Falcon (TE50/TS50/TL50) did not appear to have Tickford option plates. Instead they were fitted with a Build number plate, which contains a build number vertically on the left side, and a Tickford "Winged T" logo, the Model number (TE50/TS50/TL50) and the VIN Number on the right side. The Tickford plate, if present, can be found on the drive side of the inside of the hood, next to the coolant overflow reservoir

## Tickford Dual-Fuel LPG Option Plate

Another similar-but-different Tickford-issues Options Plate was the Factory Dual-Fuel LPG system. This system is remarkably rare and as such, so is the Option Plate. If fitted, the plate will be present on the passenger side of the engine bay, next to the Air Conditioner line, and should contain the following, in the following approximate layout

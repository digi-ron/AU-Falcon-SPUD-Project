# Component lifespans

> NOTE: This list can't possibly be completely accurate due to environmental conditions of each cars life. Estimates are based on cross-referencing of various sources, and you should **ALWAYS** verify if a part needs to be replaced before replacing if at all possible.

please refer to the table below for expected lifespans of various components, along with notes regarding failure and lifespan:

| Part Name | lifespan | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ABS Speed Sensors | 200,000km | check and replace if triggering when braking with slight steering at slow speed |
| Alternator | 250,000km | assuming no leaks from power steering, check for battery light on dash or running voltage less than 13v |
| Battery | 5 years | voltage should read 12.3-13v while car is off and 13.5-15v while car is running in idle |
| Ignition Coil Pack | 150,000km | Ignition Coil can be [tested for resistance](../../Engine/IgnitionCoil/IgnitionCoil.md#ignition-coil-resistances), known failures below 9KÎ© secondary resistance |
| Oil filter | 20,000km | assuming still using rated 5w30 |
| Power Steering High Pressure Line | 100,000km | can be made significantly longer by getting redesigned aftermarket line without gap between nut and line |
| Spark plugs (copper) | 20,000km | more likely to start phantom misfiring at idle as they start to fail |
| Spark plugs (iridium) | 75,000km | generally worth extra cost vs. Copper |
| Steering Rack | 150,000km | look out for popping noise when nearing full lock |
| Thermostat | 100,000km | can fail open (temp. constantly on C using more fuel) or fail closed (quick to overheat). Can be easily extended by using coolant rather than water for the cooling system |

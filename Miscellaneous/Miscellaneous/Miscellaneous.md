# Miscellaneous Notes

below is a list of other notes regarding the AU Falcon, which were not important or detailed enough to require a dedicated page. The list is in dot point format for brevity:

- Door entry scuff plate screw identified as 10G X 16mm Metal Screws. Prone to rust, galvanized replacement recommended (avoid self-tapping screws if possible)
- Lock/Ignition key identified as 6-cut Tibbe Key, common in Jaguar vehicles from a similar time, as well as EA-EF and BA Falcons
- Idle RPM with [ISC](../../Engine/ISC/ISC.md) disconnected should be about 500RPM, remainder is handled by [PCM](../../PCMBCM/PCM/PCM.md) tune settings
- Ignition, BCM, and PCM are linked, re-pairing for single component change not easily viable, smartlock bypass module for S1 or J3 chip for S2/3 cheapest known methods
- Ignition leads average 4.5 KÎ© resistance
- Old vehicles (300k+ highway, 200k+ neglected) proven working well using 15W40 weight oil, reduces lifter tick, oil consumption, and in some cases, oil leaks. Mineral tested (Woolworths Essentials specifically) due to low cost
- Original Ford factory manual exists in multiple government libraries as of time of writing, ISBNs below. Copying appears cost prohibitive, watermarked version of sections 2-20 available on [FordForums](../../Credits.md#sources) at time of writing:
  - SET: `0909464987`
  - VOL1: `0909464960`
  - VOL2: `0909464979`
- Pre-Catalytic Converter Oxygen sensor has a 22mm nut. Specialty tools are available through automotive retailers but a well placed adjustable spanner with a 25mm max size has been proven to work.
- [Series 1](../../Miscellaneous/SeriesInformation/SeriesInformation.md#series-1) Lower control arms (09/99 - 04/00) hard to find at time of writing. S1 recommendation is to replace the ball joint/bush(es) rather than the arm due to supply difficulties

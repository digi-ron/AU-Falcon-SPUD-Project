# Miscellaneous Notes

below is a list of other notes regarding the AU Falcon, which were not important or detailed enough to require a dedicated page. The list is in dot point format for brevity:

- Door entry scuff plate screw identified as 10G X 16mm Metal Screws. Prone to rust, galvanized replacement recommended
- Lock/Ignition key identified as 6-cut Tibbe Key, common in Jaguar vehicles
- Ignition, BCM, and ECU are linked, re-pairing for single component change non-viable

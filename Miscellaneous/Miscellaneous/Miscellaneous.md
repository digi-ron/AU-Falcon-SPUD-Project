# Miscellaneous Notes

below is a list of other notes regarding the AU Falcon, which were not important or detailed enough to require a dedicated page. The list is in dot point format for brevity:

- Door entry scuff plate screw identified as 10G X 16mm Metal Screws. Prone to rust, galvanized replacement recommended (avoid self-tapping screws if possible)
- Lock/Ignition key identified as 6-cut Tibbe Key, common in Jaguar vehicles from a similar time, as well as EA-EF and BA Falcons
- Ignition, BCM, and ECU are linked, re-pairing for single component change non-viable

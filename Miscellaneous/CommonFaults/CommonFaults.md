# Common Faults

While the AU Falcon is generally regarded as a quite reliable vehicle, there are common faults with this model that cannot be ignored. Below is a non-exhaustive list of common issues these vehicles are likely to have over the course of ownership.

<!-- TODO add link to theoretical ball joint repair instructions -->

| Fault | Models | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Air Conditioner Controls](../../Electrical/ACControls/AC-S1.md) | S1 | issues known of [solder joints cracking behind AC/AC Max buttons](../../Electrical/ACControls/AC-S1.md#repairing-solder-connections-on-the-ac-and-ac-max-buttons) and easily broken plastic dials |
| [Alternator](../../Engine/Alternator/Alternator.md) | All | prone to oil and power steering fluid ingress |
| Ball Joints | All | prone to wearing out, however simple to replace using a bearing tool |
| Brake Master Cylinder | All | tends to leak from behind, stripping the paint on the Brake Booster and surrounding painted area. Less common on S1 vehicles due to different Brake Master Cylinder used |
| Climate Control | All | High models (Fairmont/Fairlane/LTD/TL50) only, ribbon cable separation and display failure common due to time |
| Exhaust Rear Resonator | All | Wagon body only, rust common around entry and exit welds of rear resonator. Known reliable repair is to replace with straight pipe section |
| Front Brake Calipers | S1 | single piston design does not allow for hard braking on regular basis. regular maintenance is essential on these models |
| Front Brake Rotors | All | front rotors prone to warping due to brake design, Wagon and Utility body types most affected due to front brake bias |
| Fuel Sender Circuit | All | Various causes known with wiring, cluster, and sender unit, but consistent factor appears to be failure of the fuel reader in the [Instrument Cluster](../../ECUBCM/InstrumentCluster/InstrumentCluster.md) |
| Power Steering High Pressure Line | All | failure allows power steering fluid to leak onto the alternator. This then causes the alternator to fail as well |
| Rust | All | Exhaust, Middle muffler and rear section most affected |
| Rust | All - Sedan | bottom of boot lid and strut mount areas. exasperated on models fitted with a spoiler due to mount holes |
| Rust | All - Utes | section between cab and tub affected |
| Smartlock Central Locking Remote | S1 | rubber buttons prone to splitting and grime ingress. Once failed, expensive to replace with OEM remote due to low supply and relatively high demand, however [aftermarket cloning remotes are available](../../ECUBCM/Keyfob/Keyfob.md#aftermarket-replacements) to copy OEM remotes |
| Thermostat Housing | All | likely to leak through gap between top pipe end and housing end. Various causes known, most common being uneven mounting surfaces on thermostat installation |
| Water Pump | All | While OEM water pump is known good for an average of 200,000kms, aftermarket water pumps from reputable manufacturers have been known to have issues with bearing fitment and a weak plastic pulley wheel |

## Codes and What They Mean

### VIN

The Vehicle Indentification Number, or VIN, is printed on the build plate as redundant information. Further information can be found on the [VIN Plate Page](../VIN/VIN.md#vehicle-identification-number)

### SIDO Number

The Single Item Dealer Order number, or SIDO, is simply a unique build identifier for the specific vehicle. It holds very little relevance past date of original sale

### Model

The Model number is a more specific identifier of the trim model that the vehicle was built with. Refer to the tables below for what each number corresponds to:

> Some engines may be harder to identify due to changed parts since assembly. This is only a guide to what the car had from the factory, not what has been replaced or painted since.
{: .block-note}

> Any model with Tickford additions, in particular the T*50 models, should have an additional [Tickford options plate](../TickfordPlate/TickfordPlate.md) or [Tickford Dual-Fuel LPG Option Plate](../TickfordPlate/TickfordPlate.md#tickford-dual-fuel-lpg-option-plate) (depending on installed option(s))
{: .block-note}

{: .block-note}

### Trim

The trim code refers to the interior colour and accents used throughout the vehicle. Refer to the list below for what each code corresponds to:

> While these trim code will *narrow down* the exact trim inside your vehicle, it will not *uniquely identify* it, e.g. a [Series 1](../../Miscellaneous/SeriesInformation/SeriesInformation.md#series-1) Forte and a [Series 3](../../Miscellaneous/SeriesInformation/SeriesInformation.md#series-3) Fairmont share the same trim code `G1`, however the patterns in the cloth seats are different

{: .block-note}

### GVM kg

Gross Vehicle Mass, or GVM, refers to the maximum weight a vehicle can carry when fully loaded, Including the vehicle weight, passengers, cargo, fuel and other equipment. While this number is not stamped on most models, the general consensus is that the GVM would range from 2220-2740kg

> Information on this code may be incorrect due to all accessible cars for project not including values. Value range discovered through a mixture of information from the [Magnum MFG](../../Credits.md#sources) website, and internet photos of AU Falcon ute Build Plates
{: .block-note}

> This section is also present on the [Vehicle Identification Number Plate](../VIN/VIN.md#gvm-kg)
{: .block-note}

### GCM

The Gross Combination Mass, or GCM, is the maximum weight of a car and trailer combination that can be used with the vehicle. While this number is not stamped on most models, the general consensus is that the GCM would range from 3810-4790kg

> Information on this code may be incorrect due to all accessible cars for project not including values. Value range discovered through [Magnum MFG](../../Credits.md#sources) website
{: .block-note}

### BUILT

The built field contains the month and year that the vehicle was manufactured, in a `MON00` format. For example, if a car was manufactured in January of 1999 is would read `JAN99`

### Model information

The last "code" on the build plate isn't a code at all but rather a model abbreviation and body type. this code doesn't have a title on the plate and simply reads the Model Code (AU) followed by the Body Type

e.g. for a [Series 1](../../Miscellaneous/SeriesInformation/SeriesInformation.md#series-1) Forte, this would read `AU SEDAN`

e.g. for a [Series 2](../../Miscellaneous/SeriesInformation/SeriesInformation.md#series-2) Supercab, this would read `AUII UTE`

e.g. for a Series 3 SR Wagon, this would read `AUIII WGN`

# Parts Sharing

While parts sharing is perfectly common amongst most other makes and models of cars, it may be surprising to find that the AU Falcon, the only one of the (now only theoretical) "A-Series" Falcons also shares parts with other models. Parts sharing for these models come from models manufactured both before *and* after the AU. This is useful largely for sourcing aftermarket or used parts, as the scarcity of these parts will lower as time rolls on.

Please see the table below for shared parts:

> NOTE: The below table is incomplete and will be updated as more parts are discovered. Parts may also be slightly inaccurate, e.g. parts will bolt on but may need slight grinding or cutting to make fitting completely possible (e.g. for cable clearances). All parts listed have been measured up, but not all have been fitted to confirm entirely

## Parts Sharing Table

### How to read this table
- For brevity, the Interchangeable model values are all in model codes, with ranges referring to all models between, e.g. EA-AU includes EF and EL Falcons
- Any mentioned parts that have their own pages within this project are linked for convenience

# Parts Sharing

While parts sharing is perfectly common amongst most other makes and models of cars, it may be surprising to find that the AU Falcon, the only one of the (now only theoretical) "A-Series" Falcons also shares parts with other models. Parts sharing for these models come from models manufactured both before *and* after the AU. This is useful largely for sourcing aftermarket or used parts, as the scarcity of these parts will lower as time rolls on.

Please see the table below for shared parts:

> The below table is incomplete and will be updated as more parts are discovered. Parts may also be slightly inaccurate, e.g. parts will bolt on but may need slight grinding or cutting to make fitting completely possible (e.g. for cable clearances). All parts listed have been measured up, but not all have been fitted to confirm entirely

> All engine components assume SOHC/Intech/Barra 4L Inline 6 motors, as such no research has been done for any diesel or V8 variants of the listed model codes. Please do your own due diligence before buying or attempting to fit parts.

## Parts Sharing Table

### How to read this table
- For brevity, the Interchangeable model values are all in model codes, with ranges referring to all models between, e.g. EA-AU includes EF and EL Falcons
- Any mentioned parts that have their own pages within this project are linked for convenience

### Table

<!-- TODO add fuel filter doco and link -->

| Part | Interchangeable Models | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A Pillar Plastic Trim | AU-BFIII | All physically fit however care should be taken regarding tweeter mounting areas from higher models |

| [Alternator](../../Engine/Alternator/Alternator.md#special-note---series-1-vs-series-2-3) (2-pin) | AUII-BAII, SX | newer models employed a 3-pin connector which was different to the AU |
| B Pillar Plastic Trim (Upper/Lower) | AU-BFIII | All physically fit however adjustable seatbelt height not present on AUI Falcon |
| Boot Button | AU-BFIII | button uses same electrical plug but fascia is different and needs to be replaced with AU Falcon parts |

| C Pillar Plastic Trim | AU-BFIII | Body from both vehicles must match e.g. Wagon and Wagon, Sedan and Sedan |
| Cam Angle Sensor | EF-AUI | Unique VS. the AUII-III version, which in itself is unique (not used BA+) |
| [Door Handle (Outer)](../../Body/ExteriorDoorHandles/ExteriorDoorHandles.md#replacement) | AU-BFIII | certain sub-models contain additional spring that will help with longevity. BF Falcon Keyhole for drivers door not compatible due to different key types |
| [Door Lock Actuator](../../Body/DoorLockActuators/DoorLockActuators.md) | AU-BFIII, SX-SZII | AU has different plug to other models, but can be used with OEM adapter |
| Door Rubber Seals | AU-BFIII | |
| Exhaust Hangers | EA-FGX | |
| Exhaust Header | EA-AUIII | |
| Exhaust assembly (Cat Back) | EA-AUIII | Live axle Sedans and Wagons only, Body from both vehicles must match e.g. Wagon and Wagon, Sedan and Sedan |
| Front Door Shell | AU-BFIII | |
| Fuel Door Button | AU-BFIII | button uses same electrical plug but fascia is different and needs to be replaced with AU Falcon parts |
| Fuel Filter | EB-BF | |
| Fuel Injectors | EA-FGX, SX-SZII, XG-XHII | cc rating is vastly different after ED-AU, 215-220cc rating standard for AU, Tune/ECU/J3 Chip likely required. Also shares injectors with some Jeep models 2004-2008 |
| Fuel Pressure Regulator | AU-FGX | AU uses a 3 bar regulator, but 4 is standard in later models, Tune/ECU/J3 Chip likely required |
| [Ignition Coil Pack](../../Engine/IgnitionCoil/IgnitionCoil.md) | EF-AUI | only compatible with S1 AU Falcons |
| Ignition Leads | EF-AUI | only compatible with S1 AU Falcons |
| Interior Map Lights | AU-BFIII | Light inner assembly also the same as SX-SY Territory models, however fascia is different |
| [Interior Mirror](../../Body/InteriorMirror/InteriorMirror.md) | AU-FGX, SX-SZII | AUI Mirrors have grub screw mounting rather than clip, but all are interchangeable |
| Mirror Switch | EF-BFIII | |
| [PCV](../../Engine/PCV/PCV.md) | XF-FGX, SX-SZII, XG-XHII | Locations differ between models, but are all generally fitted into the top of the rocker cover. Right angle elbow may be required if a straight through unit is installed |
| Rear Door Shell | AU-BFIII | Body from both vehicles must match e.g. Wagon and Wagon, Sedan and Sedan |
| [Relay - Flasher](../../Electrical/Relays/Relays.md#3-way-flasher-relay) | XD-AUIII, XG-XHII, ZL-NL | predates electrically controlled indicators, requires LED specific replacement if indicator circuit wattage dramatically changed |

| [Relays (OEM 5-Way Green)](../../Electrical/Relays/Relays.md#5-way-mini-iso-relay) | XD-BFIII, XG-XHII, SX-SYII, ZL-NL | relay standard is universal, but OEM ones have been in use for quite some time |
| [Relays (OEM 4-Way White)](../../Electrical/Relays/Relays.md#4-way-mini-iso-relay) | XD-FGX, XG-XHII, SX-SZ, ZL-NL | relay standard is universal, but OEM ones have been in use for quite some time |

Note bar length is slightly shorter on AU-AUIII VS BA-BFIII Falcon Sedans, but Wagons are the same dimensions |
| [Roof Racks (Factory-Fitted Station Wagon Rail)](../../Body/RoofRacks/RoofRacks.md#station-wagons-with-factory-rails) | AU-BFIII | Uses Gutter-mount style mounting mechanism. using adjustable length roof racks for fleet-vehicle models such as a Toyota Hiace (low Roof preferred) or a Mitsubishi Express may be a cheap source of roof racks |

# Parts Sharing

While parts sharing is perfectly common amongst most other makes and models of cars, it may be surprising to find that the AU Falcon, the only one of the (now only theoretical) "A-Series" Falcons also shares parts with other models. Parts sharing for these models come from models manufactured both before *and* after the AU. This is useful largely for sourcing aftermarket or used parts, as the scarcity of these parts will lower as time rolls on.

Please see the table below for shared parts:

> NOTE: The below table is incomplete and will be updated as more parts are discovered. Parts may also be slightly inaccurate, e.g. parts will bolt on but may need slight grinding or cutting to make fitting completely possible (e.g. for cable clearances). All parts listed have been measured up, but not all have been fitted to confirm entirely

> NOTE: All engine components assume SOHC/Intech/Barra 4L Inline 6 motors, as such no research has been done for any diesel or V8 variants of the listed model codes. Please do your own due diligence before buying or attempting to fit parts.

## Parts Sharing Table

### How to read this table
- For brevity, the Interchangeable model values are all in model codes, with ranges referring to all models between, e.g. EA-AU includes EF and EL Falcons
- Any mentioned parts that have their own pages within this project are linked for convenience

### Table

| Part | Interchangeable Models | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A Pillar Plastic Trim | AU-BFIII | All physically fit however care should be taken regarding tweeter mounting areas from higher models |
| Air box | EF-AUIII | piping from BA-BFIII Falcon also compatible, but air box itself does not bolt to body correctly |
| B Pillar Plastic Trim (Upper/Lower) | AU-BFIII | All physically fit however adjustable seatbelt height not present on AUI Falcon |
| Boot Button | AU-BFIII | button uses same electrical plug but fascia is different and needs to be replaced with AU Falcon parts |
| C Pillar Plastic Trim | AU-BFIII | Body from both vehicles must match e.g. Wagon and Wagon, Sedan and Sedan |
| [Door Handle (Outer)](../../Body/ExteriorDoorHandles/ExteriorDoorHandles.md#replacement) | AU-BFIII | certain sub-models contain additional spring that will help with longevity. BF Falcon Keyhole for drivers door not compatible due to different key types |
| [Door Lock Actuator](../../Body/DoorLockActuators/DoorLockActuators.md) | AU-BFIII, SX-SZII | AU has different plug to other models, but can be used with OEM adapter |
| Engine Belt Cover | EF-AUIII, XH-XHII | Requires 13mm bolt with 10mm thread on top. AU VCT cover compatible with non-VCT models, but not vice versa |
| Exhaust Header | EA-AUIII | |
| Exhaust assembly (Cat Back) | EA-AUIII | Live axle Sedans and Wagons only, Body from both vehicles must match e.g. Wagon and Wagon, Sedan and Sedan |
| Front Door Shell | AU-BFIII | |
| Fuel Door Button | AU-BFIII | button uses same electrical plug but fascia is different and needs to be replaced with AU Falcon parts |
| Fuel Injectors | EA-FGX, SX-SZII, XG-XHII | cc rating is vastly different, 215-220cc rating standard for AU, Tune/ECU/J3 Chip likely required |
| Fuel Pressure Regulator | AU-FGX | AU uses a 3 bar regulator, but 4 is standard in later models, Tune/ECU/J3 Chip likely required |
| [Ignition Coil Pack](../../Engine/IgnitionCoil/IgnitionCoil.md) | EF-AU | only compatible with S1 AU Falcons |
| Ignition Leads | EF-AU | only compatible with S1 AU Falcons |
| [Interior Mirror](../../Body/InteriorMirror/InteriorMirror.md) | AU-FGX, SX-SZII | AUI Mirrors have grub screw mounting rather than clip, but all are interchangeable |
| Mirror Switch | EF-BFIII | |
| [PCV](../../Engine/PCV/PCV.md) | XF-FGX, SX-SZII, XG-XHII | Locations differ between models, but are all generally fitted into the top of the rocker cover. Right angle elbow may be required if a straight through unit is installed |
| Rear Door Shell | AU-BFIII | Body from both vehicles must match e.g. Wagon and Wagon, Sedan and Sedan |
| [Relay - Flasher](../../Electrical/Relays/Relays.md#3-way-flasher-relay) | XD-AUIII, XG-XHII, ZL-NL | predates electrically controlled indicators, requires LED specific replacement if indicator circuit wattage dramatically changed |
| [Relays (OEM 4-Way Black)](../../Electrical/Relays/Relays.md#4-way-micro-iso-relay) | AU-FGX, SX-SZ | newer relay style than white 4 way or green 5 way relays |
| [Relays (OEM 5-Way Green)](../../Electrical/Relays/Relays.md#5-way-mini-iso-relay) | XD-BFIII, XG-XHII, SX-SYII, ZL-NL | relay standard is universal, but OEM ones have been in use for quite some time |
| [Relays (OEM 4-Way White)](../../Electrical/Relays/Relays.md#4-way-mini-iso-relay) | XD-FGX, XG-XHII, SX-SZ, ZL-NL | relay standard is universal, but OEM ones have been in use for quite some time |
| Roof Racks (Door-Mount) ([Sedan](../../Body/RoofRacks/RoofRacks.md#sedans)\|[Wagon](../../Body/RoofRacks/RoofRacks.md#station-wagons-without-factory-rails)\|[Ute](../../Body/RoofRacks/RoofRacks.md#utes)) | AU-BFIII | Body from both vehicles must match e.g. Wagon and Wagon, Sedan and Sedan. Note bar length is slightly shorter on AU-AUIII VS BA-BFIII Falcon Sedans, but Wagons are the same dimensions |
| [Roof Racks (Factory-Fitted Station Wagon Rail)](../../Body/RoofRacks/RoofRacks.md#station-wagons-with-factory-rails) | AU-BFIII | Uses Gutter-mount style mounting mechanism. using adjustable length roof racks for fleet-vehicle models such as a Toyota Hiace (low Roof preferred) or a Mitsubishi Express may be a cheap source of roof racks |

| [Spark Plugs](../../Engine/SparkPlugs/SparkPlugs.md) | EA-AUIII, XG-XHII | |
| [Speakers (Front)](../../Audio/Speakers/Speakers.md) | AU-BFIII | |

| Starter Motor | EA-BFIII, XG-XHII, SX-SZII | |
| Towbar | AU-FGX | Utes and Wagon body styles only, Body from both vehicles must match e.g. Wagon and Wagon, Ute and Ute |
| [Trailer Plug](../../Electrical/TrailerPlug/TrailerPlug.md) | AU-BA | May match later models, however easiest with AU/BA submodels without fog-lights as they are a known exact match |
| Weathershields (Front) | AU-BFIII | Aftermarket or OEM inclusive |
| Weathershields (Rear) | AU-BFIII | Aftermarket only as OEM part not manufactured. Body from both vehicles must match e.g. Wagon and Wagon, Sedan and Sedan |

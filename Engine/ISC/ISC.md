# Idle Speed Controller (ISC)

> This information is only relevant to the I6 models, due to lack of information on V8 models available
{: .block-note}

The Idle Speed Controller is the component on top of the Throttle body at the top of the motor responsible for controlling the idle while the throttle is completely shut.

## Diagnosis

Only one known test is available for the ISC to check for failure without removal, which is the vehicles inability to reliably cold start. Note that this is *not* a reliable test, and the movement of the ISC inner spring should be tested to confirm this diagnosis.

## Location

See the below picture for the exact location of the ISC on the I6 models of AU Falcon

## Removal

To remove the ISC, simply remove the 2 allen head bolts holding the controller in using a 5mm allen key.

> There is a small gasket under these controllers, be careful when removing unless you have a replacement gasket handy, as they will cause excess air issues if there is a gap on reinstallation

## Cleaning

An important note on cleaning the components in the throttle body area of the engine is to <span class="bad-highlight">never use degreaser</span>. The correct cleaning products to use to ensure nothing is damaged by the cleaning product is one of the following:

- Throttle body cleaner
- Brake cleaner
- Paper towels
- Cotton swabs (if really required)

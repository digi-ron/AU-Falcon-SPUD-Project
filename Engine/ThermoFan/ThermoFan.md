# Thermo Fan

The thermo fans are the fans located directly behind the radiator, which can be easily removed for access to components towards the front of the engine bay. Removal steps are below:

1. Remove the 2 phillips head screws holding the intake snorkel to the airbox, and remove by pulling the snorkel from the airbox.

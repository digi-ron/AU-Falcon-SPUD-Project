## Location

The fuel filter is located under the Passenger side of the vehicle, near the chassis rail. it should be quite far back on the line, close to the differential housing.

### Equipment

For this replacement the following equipment is required:

- 14mm spanner (flare nut preferred)
- 19mm spanner
- 2x small flat head screwdrivers

1. jack the car up from the passenger side, and get under the car. If available, use penetrating fluid on the engine side of the filter, where the line screws into the filter.

1. Use the 2 screwdrivers, or if available the fuel line removal tool, to press the spring inside the fuel line end coming from the fuel tank, and remove the tank lines

1. Unbolt the engine side fuel line from the filter using the 2 spanners

    > The best known method for this is to keep the 19mm spanner still while unscrewing the line nut using the 14mm

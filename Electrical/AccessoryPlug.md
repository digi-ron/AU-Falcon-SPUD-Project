# Accessory plug

## How to find it
The accessory plug is a blue plug that should be easy enough to find under the driver-side dash, You are looking for a 4-way quick connect connector, which should be a deep blue color.

## IMPORTANT
These quick connect connectors are somewhat generic, and as such many manufacturers sell then, however ensure you buy the ones with the key notches on the *same side* as the locking clip, and some are manufactured with them on the opposite side and will ***NOT*** fit as a result

# Accessory plug

## How to find it
The accessory plug is a blue plug that should be easy enough to find under the driver-side dash, You are looking for a 4-way quick connect connector, which should be a deep blue color.
<!--TODO add a photo?-->

## IMPORTANT
These quick connect connectors are somewhat generic, and as such many manufacturers sell then, however ensure you buy the ones with the key notches on the *same side* as the locking clip, and some are manufactured with them on the opposite side and will ***NOT*** fit as a result

<!--TODO add photo comparison-->

## Pinout
Use the following diagram and pinout list for reference. This diagram assumes that the clip is facing up and you are looking at the female housing connector (the blue plug or loom end wiring connector)

# Interior Driver Buttons

## Lock & Fuel Buttons

### Lock button - additional

While the lock button isn't special due to anything technically interesting about it, it is surprisingly absent from the Series 1 AU Falcons. Making things even stranger, the lock button was reinstated in the Series 2 as part of a moderate interior redesign, and existed on the previous EF Body Ford Falcon *and* the Series 1 Fairlane models (as a [Centre Console Button](../CentreConsoleButtons/CentreConsoleButtons.md)). The reason for this omission is unknown.

### Plug Type

The plug for the lock and the fuel release buttons are a 090 connector, originally manufactured by the companies Yazaki and Sumitomo

### Pin Layout

The following assume you are looking at the loom end connector with the clip facing up

> The wiring in these switches is completely interchangeable thanks to the fact that it is simply button circuitry. This is only added for clarity

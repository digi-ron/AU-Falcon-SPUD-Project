# Trailer Auxillary plug

The plugs used for the trailer adapter loom are different to other plugs within the interior, and are a bit of an oddball connector for the car as a whole. This is likely due to Hayman Reese being the manufacturers for a large range of the tow pack options for the AU Falcon, particularly any of the higher-rated towbars. as a result the connector is known as a HM connector, apparently manufactured by a company known as Sumitomo.

> NOTE: this plug appears to be standard in all Falcons AU-BFIII (1998-2016) and all Territory models, however pinout may be different due to additional features

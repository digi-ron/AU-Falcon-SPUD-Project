# Rear Lights Connector

The rear light connector can be a great location to wire in Accessory trigger wire(s) for auxiliary system such as a reversing camera. In the case that you would like to tap into this wiring without soldering or modifying the vehicles own wiring loom, the following information could be found to be useful.

## Plug Type

The plug used for the tail light connector is known as a 250 Series Quick Connect 6-way connector. There are many manufacturers for these connectors such as [Narva](../../Credits.md#sources), and as such it should be relatively trivial to find one from an Automotive Shop

description: information and pinouts for the accessory buttons fitted to the 1999-2002 Ford Falcon AU (e.g. TCS, ABS, ANT.)

# Centre Console Buttons
The buttons within the centre dash area of the car use connectors that are simply known as 090 Connectors, likely manufactured by a company known as Yazaki. These are similar connectors to those used throughout other interior plugs within the AU Falcon Cabin in particular.

## Plug Information

| Name | Code | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Female Housing | 7122-1300 | Button end connector |
| Male Connector | 7123-1300 | Loom end connector |

## Pin layout
The following notes assume pin numbers where you are looking at the switch unit itself, with the clip cut-out facing up:

| `01` | `02` | `--` | `--` | `03` | `04` |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **`05`** | **`06`** | **`07`** | **`08`** | **`09`** | **`10`** |

> NOTE: each of the following plugs are the same as above, but with some variation to active pins and latching

### Specifics - TCS button
On models where a Traction control System is present, a Traction control button can be found. This button has 4 accessible pins, and is a momentary switch:

- 01 =  switch activation (- assumed)
- 02 = blank (cut pin)
- 03 = switch activation (+ assumed)
- 04 = blank (cut pin)
- 05 = blank
- 06 = blank
- 07 = blank
- 08 = blank
- 09 = illumination light (- assumed)
- 10 = illumination light (+ assumed)

### Specifics - ANT button
On models where an electric antenna is present, a ANT button can be found. This button has 4 pins accessible, but is a toggle switch. This means that this is easier to use these buttons as a base for custom wiring without the need for a logic board or latching relay:

- 01 = blank (cut pin)
- 02 = switch activation (- assumed)
- 03 = blank (cut pin)
- 04 = switch activation (+ assumed)
- 05 = blank
- 06 = blank
- 07 = blank
- 08 = blank
- 09 = illumination light (- assumed)
- 10 = illumination light (+ assumed)

### Specifics - ECON button
On models fitted with a column shifter (e.g. bench seat optioned utes), an ECON button is fitted to the centre dash with the same plugs as the other buttons on this page. This button has 6 accessible pins, and is a momentary switch:

- 01 = switch activation (CONT to pins 02,03,04)
- 02 = switch activation (CONT to pins 01,03,04)
- 03 = switch activation (CONT to pins 01,02,04)
- 04 = switch activation (CONT to pins 01,02,03)
- 05 = blank
- 06 = blank
- 07 = illumination light (- assumed)
- 08 = illumination light (+ assumed)

## replacing button faces
For cases where you wish to modify buttons to have different pictures than the one that came from the factory, or in the case that you wish to use a connector with more active pins or a latching switch, you can remove the faces by gently prying 2 tabs (one each side) of the face. the faces can then be placed back in the switches with a firm press, however note that they will not go in upside-down, and there should be minimal force required to press them back into place

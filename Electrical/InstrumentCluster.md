# Instrument Cluster
## Plug type
The plugs in the back of the instrument cluster all seem to be MULTILOCK 040 II connectors, seemingly manufactured by a company called TE Connectivity. Part information varies according to which specific plug is desired.

## IMPORTANT
note that the plugs are MULTILOCK 040 II and not MULTILOCK 040, as there are subtle differences between the 2 versions

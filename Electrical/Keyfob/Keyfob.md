# Central Locking Keyfobs

## Types
Due to the change from Smartlock to Smartshield midway through the AU Falcon S1 production, the key fobs for these cars are split in 2

### S1 Smartlock
These remotes are actually inherited from the EL Falcon before it, and are a 304mHz sender with a Ford specific security chip built in. As a result of their age, finding good condition original ones are becoming harder, and even once found the rubber buttons are prone to wearing quicker than their S2-3 counterparts.

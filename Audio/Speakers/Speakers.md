# Speakers

## Sizes

The size of most speakers across the AU Falcon range are 5x7" oval speakers, which is a less than standard size. Note that 6x9" speakers can be used in both locations, however additional holes will need to be drilled to allow for them, and special care must be taken for the front door speakers depth, as they can foul the window mechanism

Exceptions to this include:
- Wagon Rear Speakers (speakers are seemingly 4-5")

## Plug
The standard speakers used in the AU Falcon are known as a 250 Series Quick Connect 2-way connector. They are easy enough to identify as they have a T-shaped housing on them. There are many manufacturers for these connectors, and such it should be relatively trivial to find one from an Automotive Shop

## Replacement

> NOTE: you will need a uncommon bit for this job, an E-Torx XXX. These can be found in certain screwdriver or drill driver bit sets. Alternatively there is known mixed success using either a XXmm socket or a pair of vice grip pliers (however the latter should only be used if a new screw is going to replace it as it will likely damage the head of the screw)

<!--TODO work out the exact bit needed-->

### Driver Door Speakers
Follow the steps below to replace the driver door speakers:
1. Remove the door card, noting the following:
    - Manual window winding models will need to have the handle removed first (use a phillips head screwdriver)
    - Electronic window models will need to have the button plate gently removed (use a trim removal tool or a flat head screwdriver)
    <!--TODO add a photo showing roughly where all the screws are-->
1. Remove the 4 screws holding the speaker into place and unplug the speaker from the wiring loom
1. do one of the following:
    - if keeping the original loom, create an adapter with a [2 way quick connector](#plug) on one end, and the spade connectors for your speakers on the other
    - if modifying the loom, cut and crimp or solder the spade connectors for your speakers onto the loom
    <!--TODO add more information on wiring-->
1. Connect your speaker to the wiring harness and reinstall into the door

    > NOTE: now is a good time to test that the speakers are connected correctly by turning on the radio

1. reinstall the door card, remembering to reconnect the window winder handle (on manual winding models) or the electronic window panel (on electronic window models)

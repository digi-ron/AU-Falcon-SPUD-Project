{: block-note}

Some models of the AU Falcon were optioned with the Premium Audio System, which improves the audio solution of the vehicle by adding an external amplifier and a subwoofer (in some bodys). This is easier to find in the "Upmarket" models of the vehicle, such as the Fairmont GHIA or Fairlane, however any model could be optioned with it, assuming it was requested at the time of original purchase

## Subwoofer

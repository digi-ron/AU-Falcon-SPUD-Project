  > *sold a "coded" AUI remote for a $50 markup vs. a clean fob. Remote didn't work and I was given the runaround when asked for information to get it working. Support took 8 days, 6 of which were spent by them not responding to the simple question of "what is the KEYDIY configuration you used on this clearly KEYDIY fob?", and 1 wasted finding out that real locksmiths have had issues with these remotes. The kicker: I'm confident they don't even code them, not that they ever mentioned that the 3 different times I asked*

  > *Sent an email 8/10/24 asking for as much info as they were willing to give me on the SmartLock fobs, so I can make a DIY guide to prevent scalpers having the last say. 3 weeks of silence and a follow up email and they finally respond to me: "Sorry we can't help". Yeah, I know, hell, I knew way before I emailed you again but I decided to anyways, just in case I was wrong and I might yet get information from, y'know, the manufacturers themselves maybe? Best they could do was point me to my local dealership, which I went to before emailing anyways. It would appear they can really only be trusted to send me [verification letters](./Miscellaneous/VerificationLetter/Verification.md)*

## About the Author (And Project SPUD Lore)

Hi, my name's Ronnie, and I've always been a fan of the AU Falcon since I was young. It all started when Dad got a white Forte Wagon that lasted nearly 500,000kms while towing a 2 tonne trailer when I was a kid. That car only got taken off the road because the rear-end needed significant work to pass a NSW Roadworthy, and it was a bush bomb for a little while but we had to get rid of it for money eventually.

Flash-forward to 2018 and I was very keen to upgrade from my first car, a wrecker-sold 1995 Ford Festiva Trio which was costing me half as much in oil as fuel and putting me $1,000 down each year for NSW roadworthy repairs. And there it was, a Series 3 SR Wagon in Venom Red, 150,000-ish kms on the clock and logbook servicing all the way through. Needless to say I snapped it up the moment I took it for a test drive and haggled with the dealer, and it's been mostly bliss since (barring some factory parts turning to dust and the damn high pressure steering line)

The more I looked into "off the reserve" repairs and modifications to Falcons, the more I realized that the few sites that ever had information on these models were "drying up", with links that went nowhere, posts no newer than 2010 with anything useful in them, and one site that kept trying to redirect me to some kind of scam, despite having actual content on there once you block all the popups and crap. I tried 3 different workshop manuals, and still had questions on a few things not covered by any of them, and admittedly, things were getting a bit hopeless.

Refusing defeat but wanting to keep my SR usable as a daily, I got a Series 1 Forte Sedan from a mate for cheap. The car had a known rough history from at least one negligent owner, and she'd been sitting out in the weather doing nothing for months at a time, but she ran, and that was enough for me.

April 11th 2024, Project SPUD was born.

I have no mechanical background, I'm a web developer by trade and the only reason I know my way around a toolbox is thanks to the fact Dad used to be an engineer and I like learning new things. I learned half the stuff I know about Falcons fixing my own AUs and some mates vehicles that were similar enough (BA/BF/FG/SX). I published this site on the wider net in case anyone else needs some of the weird info from the rabbit holes I went down, because I can say with 100% certainty that there is a few things in here that you couldn't hope to find in the usual suspect sites. A good portion of the information is electrical in nature, this is simply down to a mix of my skillset and how much better documented mechanical repairs for this model are (where I had nothing to add).

  > *sold a "coded" AUI remote for a $50 markup vs. a clean fob. Remote didn't work and I was given the runaround when asked for information to get it working. Support took 8 days, 6 of which were spent by them not responding to the simple question of "what is the KEYDIY configuration you used on this clearly KEYDIY fob?", and 1 wasted finding out that real locksmiths have had issues with these remotes. The kicker: I'm confident they don't even code them, not that they ever mentioned that the 3 different times I asked*

## About the Author

Hi, my name's Ronnie, and I've always been a fan of the AU Falcon since I was young. It all started when Dad got a Forte Wagon that lasted nearly 500,000kms while towing a 2 tonne trailer when I was a kid. That car only got taken off the road because the rear-end needed significant work to pass a NSW Roadworthy, and it was a bush bomb for a little while but we had to get rid of it for money eventually.

Flash-forward to 2018 and I was very keen to upgrade from my first car, a 1995 Ford Festiva Trio. And there it was, a Series 3 SR Wagon in Venom Red, 150,000-ish kms on the clock and logbook servicing all the way through. Needless to say I snapped it up the moment I took it for a test drive and haggled with the dealer, and it's been mostly bliss since (barring some factory parts turning to dust and the damn high pressure steering line)

The more I looked into "off the reserve" repairs and modifications to Falcons, the more I realized that the forums that once housed a wealth of knowledge on the models were compromised, with one constantly redirecting to scam ad sites, and one with a bunch of missing resources and very few useful posts on the AU since about 2010 (likely as by then the new hotness was the B Series). On top of that some of the information I wanted couldn't be found online at all or in the 3 workshop manuals I looked through, which was making things a bit hopeless. Refusing defeat but wanting to keep my SR usable as a daily, I got a Series 1 Forte Sedan from a mate for cheap. The car had a known rough history from at least one negligent owner, and she'd been sitting out in the weather doing nothing for months at a time, but she ran, and that was enough for me.

April 11th 2024, Project SPUD was born.

I have no mechanical background, I'm a programmer by trade and the only reason I know my way around a toolbox is thanks to the fact Dad used to be an engineer and I like learning new things. I learned half the stuff I know about the models fixing my own car and similar vehicles that were in my circle (mostly BA/BF Falcons but still, it counts)

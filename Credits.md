  > *sold a "coded" AUI remote for a $50 markup vs. a clean fob. Remote didn't work and I was given the runaround when asked for information to get it working. Support took 8 days, 6 of which were spent by them not responding to the simple question of "what is the KEYDIY configuration you used on this clearly KEYDIY fob?", and 1 wasted finding out that real locksmiths have had issues with these remotes. The kicker: I'm confident they don't even code them, not that they ever mentioned that the 3 different times I asked*

# Seatbelts

The seatbelts in the AU Falcons are largely easy to replace but require a single tool that may not be found in a standard toolbox, a T50 Torx socket. a 3/8" drive socket and ratchet is recommended as the bolts can be easily accessed without the ratchet fouling on the seat or without having a lack of leverage from a short handled 1/4" ratchet.

## Replacement

<!--TODO add photos-->

1. remove the single T50 bolt holding the end of the seatbelt to the floor
1. while holding the end of the seatbelt away from where the bolt was, thread the seatbelt through the upper B-Pillar trim plastic. Try to keep as much tension on the seatbelt as possible while doing this, as it makes the process easier
1. (optional) tie the end of the seatbelt to a section of the seatbelt inbetween the upper anchor and the lower B-Pillar plastic trim. This will prevent the seatbelt from retracting too far and too fast upon removal, potentially saving the mechanism if you wish the reuse it
1. unscrew the 2 upper screws on the lower B-Pillar trim piece using a phillips head screwdriver, and gently pull the plastic from the chassis, noting that it is help in with 2 large metal clips towards the bottom.
1. using the T50 socket, remove the bolt holding the retraction mechanism to the chassis.
1. using the T50 socket, remove the bolt holding the top anchor for the seatbelt in place.
1. remove assembly as a complete unit  with seatbelt, anchor, and retraction mechanism
1. done

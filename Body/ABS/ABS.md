# Antilock Braking System (ABS)

The antilock braking system, or ABS, is a basic safety system built into the AU Falcon.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

> Note that removing the ABS Fuse specifically will also disable headlights if they are still installed. The reason for this is unknown at this time but is assumed to be a shared circuit. Disregard if headlights have been removed as part of a track conversion or other similar modification.

## Components

The components of the AU Falcon ABS System are as follows:

- ABS Module
- ABS Fuse
- ABS Sensor x4

### ABS Module

The ABS Module is the electrical heart of the ABS, containing a metal construction actuator which can individually activate brakes for each individual wheel when an ABS event is triggered. It is identifiable by the multiple brake lines coming out of the top of the module, and is located at the driver side of the engine bay, next to the [Engine Bay Fuse Box](../../Electrical/Fuses/Fuses.md#engine-bay)

### ABS Sensor

The ABS Sensors are the sensors which measure the speed of the wheels on the vehicle, in order to activate ABS should it become required.

## Disabling the ABS

In some circumstances, it may be beneficial to disable and remove the ABS functionality from the car. Common reasons include track use and to bypass [known issues with the ABS](../../Miscellaneous/CommonFaults/CommonFaults.md#common-faults).

> Disabling the ABS is *not* a recommended action. Please proceed at your own risk

In order to disable the ABS, follow the steps according to the conditions in the below table:

<!-- TODO add additional links -->

| Condition | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Headlights not required | [Remove the ABS Fuse](#remove-the-abs-fuse) |
| Headlights required, permanently disable | [Remove a front ABS Sensor](#remove-a-front-abs-sensor) |
| Headlights required, temporary disable | [Remove the ABS Module plug](#remove-the-abs-module-plug) |

### Remove the ABS Fuse

<!-- TODO add pictures -->

1. Open the [Engine Cabin Fuse](../../Electrical/Fuses/Fuses.md#engine-bay)
1. Undo the 2 clips holding the inner fuse panel in and lift the assembly from the fuse box
1. Carefully undo and remove the 8mm bolt holding the passenger side of the ABS fuse to the inner assembly.

    > Removing the Low Headlight, fuel and Fan #2 relays can assist in access to this bolt. Removal of this bolt with a phillips head screwdriver is not recommended as the phillips head is likely to round out.
    {: .block-note}

1. Carefully undo and remove the 10mm bolt holding the driver side of the ABS fuse to the inner assembly.

    > A short length 1/4" ratchet and 10mm socket can assist in removal of this bolt. Removal of this bolt with a phillips head screwdriver is not recommended due to risk of rounding out the head and the tight working area.

1. Pull the ABS fuse from the fuse panel
1. (optional) Reinstall the 8mm and 10mm bolts to the threaded nuts inside the inner fuse housing
1. In order to reinstall, reverse all previous steps
1. Done

### Remove a front ABS Sensor

> Lack of images due to job not completed
{: .block-note}

1. With the car running, turn the steering all the way to either the left (if removing the passenger sensor) or right (if removing the driver sensor)
1. Reach around to the rear of the wheel hub and locate the 7mm bolt holding the sensor in, and remove it

    > This bolt is quite long and will take some time to remove.
    {: .block-note}

1. Pull the sensor from the back of the wheel hub
1. In order to replace the sensor, reverse all previous steps
1. Done

### Remove the ABS Module plug

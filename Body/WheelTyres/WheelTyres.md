## General notes - how to read tyre sizes

using the example of 205/65R15:

- 205 is the width in mm (from outer to inner rim) of the tyre
- 65 is the aspect, so the percentage of the tyre width that makes the section width (distance from edge of the tyre to the edge of the rim).
- R15 is the size of the rim it is designed for, in inches

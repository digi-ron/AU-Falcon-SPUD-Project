# Wheels & Tyres

## Known factory tyre sizes
use the below table as a reference for wheel sizes that should fit all models of Falcon, sorted by rolling diameter:

| Size | Diameter | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 225/50R16 | 632mm | XR6/XR8 |
| 215/55R16 | 643mm | Falcon S |
| 235/45R17 | 644mm | TL50/TE50/TS50 |
| 205/65R15 | 648mm | low models S1 |
| 215/60R16 | 653mm | low models S2&3 |
| 245/40R18 | 654mm | TS50 |
| 225/50R17 | 657mm | Fairmont GHIA |
| 225/60R16 | 677mm | Fairlane GHIA |

## General Notes - How to Read Tyre Sizes

using the example of 205/65R15:

- 205 is the width in mm (from outer to inner rim) of the tyre
- 65 is the aspect, so the percentage of the tyre width that makes the section width (distance from edge of the tyre to the edge of the rim).
- R15 is the size of the rim it is designed for, in inches

## Offsets

### Default offsets
Available information for the AU Falcon suggests that the OEM wheels fitted to all submodels generally ranged from +30mm to +50mm offset. It should be noted that pre-AU vehicles have a closer offset (approx. +10mm) and as such tend to foul on AU Falcon components

### Limits
Success has been reported using wheels up to and including the 18x9.5 sizing, assuming appropriate sized tyres are fitted (generally those with tyres around the stock rolling diameter, e.g. 265/35R18) and assuming an offset of approximately +20mm. This however leaves very little clearance room and may not be desirable for driving comfort.

## Other notable information

- PCD: 5x114.3
- Lug Nut Information: 1/2" UNF Thread with approx. 40mm TL

## Wheel Dust Covers

many AU Falcons came with wheel dust covers that functioned by blocking brake dust from settling on the mag wheel options that the model had, however they came with their own long term problems, such as:

- Becoming rusty over time (for models with steel covers)
- Fouling on the side of brake calipers if dented, and most importantly;
- Becoming a potential catalyst for front brake rotor warping conditions, a significant maintenance problem within these models

If the additional cleaning of the wheels is acceptable, it is recommended that you remove these covers as they cause more problems than they solve on the whole

## Removal
Removal of the wheel dust covers is simple, as below:
1. Remove the desired wheel
1. Pull the dust cover from the exposed area, noting:

    - Mag wheels with plastic covers will need to have the covers broken off in order to remove them. There is no known way to remove the covers in a single piece to date.
    - Mag wheels with steel covers may have the covers rusted to the brake rotor. If this is the case ***DO NOT*** use prying tools as this may damage the brakes

1. Reinstall the wheel, noting:

    - Before you install the wheel, now may be a good time to clean behind the wheel unobstructed
    - You should tighten as much as possible while the wheel is in the air, then tighten again once the car is on the ground, to ensure a snug fit

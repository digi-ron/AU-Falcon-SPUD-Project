## Location

The BCM can be accessed from the passenger side of the front driver footwell:

<!-- TODO add BCM location pictures -->

1. Pull the BCM down gently to access the plugs, and unplug all plugs by pressing in each tab
1. remove the BCM from the dash location
1. done

## Model Variations

There are 2 types of BCM available for the AU Falcon, the Low model and the High model. The low models are the most common type of BCM installed, as the high models were generally only available for premium models such as the XR series, Fairmonts, Fairlanes, LTDs and T-Series vehicles. The high and low BCMs are also different colours depending on the series in which they were installed, further complicating matters. Thankfully the BCM can be easily identified by colour, using the table below:

> XR models and Low models with premium features added were fitted with High model BCMs, with functionality only wired in as required for the optioned features.

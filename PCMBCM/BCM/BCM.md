# Body Control Module (BCM)

The BCM of the AU Falcon controls many auxillary functions of the vehicle, including but not limited to:

- Alarm (S2-3 models only)
- Central Locking & [Smartlock](../Keyfob/Keyfob.md#s1-smartlock)/[Smartshield](../Keyfob/Keyfob.md#s2s3-smartshield)
- Diagnostic communications (e.g. [DTCs](../DTCCodes/DTCCodes.md))
- Door lock and boot functionality
- Headlight alert
- [Instrument Cluster](../InstrumentCluster/InstrumentCluster.md) communications
- Interior Illumination
- [PCM](../PCM/PCM.md) communications (including immobilizer)
- Power Antenna (where fitted)
- Power Windows (where fitted)
- Rear Demister
- Window wipers

## Model Variations

There are 2 types of BCM available for the AU Falcon, the Low model and the High model. The low models are the most common type of BCM installed, as the high models were generally only available for premium models such as the XR series, Fairmonts, Fairlanes, LTDs and T-Series vehicles. The high and low BCMs are also different colours depending on the series in which they were installed, further complicating matters. Thankfully the BCM can be easily identified by colour, using the table below:

> XR models and Low models with premium features added were fitted with High model BCMs, with functionality only wired in as required for the optioned features.
